;;;; Worker-side half of code-find-references' impact analysis.  It turns a
;;;; symbol as written into a symbol without interning anything, decides
;;;; which of the parent's source-scan sites really name that symbol in this
;;;; image, and merges those sites with SBCL's xref entries.  It reads no
;;;; files and does not depend on eclector, so the worker image stays free of
;;;; the parent's parsing stack.
